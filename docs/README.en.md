**Run Pi, Claude Code, DeepSeek Harness, Grok, and Antigravity inside [Codex Desktop](https://openai.com/codex/)**

We believe **Codex Desktop** currently provides one of the best desktop development experiences.

But **Codex** is not the only capable **Agent Harness**. Some developers prefer **Claude Code**, **Pi Agent**, **DeepSeek Harness**, **Grok CLI**, or **Antigravity**.

**codexhost** lets you choose the **Agent** that actually executes your tasks inside **Codex Desktop**, while preserving the native Codex experience.

## Interface Preview

Pi, Claude Code, DeepSeek Harness, Grok, and Antigravity run as independent sessions in the same Codex Desktop window. Streaming output, thinking, tool status, diffs, approvals, and questions are rendered in real time when supported by each Harness.

## Quick Start

**Option 1: Install with npm**

```bash
npm install -g @codexhost/cli
codexhost
```

**Option 2: Download an installer**

Download the latest installer from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/BytePioneer-AI/codex-host/releases), then choose the file matching your operating system and CPU architecture.

After installing on macOS, if Apple says it cannot verify the app when you first open it, run the following command in Terminal:
```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/codexhost.app
```
Then open `codexhost` again.

### Using Antigravity

Install and authenticate the CLI using the [official Antigravity instructions](https://antigravity.google/), verify that `agy --version` works, and select **Antigravity** from the Agent picker. If `agy` is outside `PATH`, set `CODEXHOST_ANTIGRAVITY_COMMAND=/absolute/path/to/agy`.

The MVP consumes the CLI's `stream-json` output and resumes the official `conversation_id`. It never adds a permission-bypass flag. Model, Thinking, permission-mode, Fork, and rollback selection are currently unsupported; see the [Antigravity Harness guide](antigravity-harness.md).

The Composer input repair is scoped to Codex composers marked with `data-codex-composer-root`. Copy, paste, cut, Backspace, Delete, IME input, and `Shift+Enter` remain owned by the official editor. Only an unready submission route is blocked, and the draft is preserved.

<details>
<summary><h3>How it works</h3></summary>

Most multi-agent clients connect different Harnesses through the [ACP](https://agentclientprotocol.com/) protocol. This is quick to integrate, but native capabilities such as tools, approvals, permissions, diffs, and questions are first reduced to a common denominator and then approximated again in the UI.

codexhost takes a different approach:

- **Desktop layer:** Use CDP / Electron Inspector to enhance the official Codex Desktop with Agent selection and session controls. The chat shell is not recreated, and the official installer is not modified.
- **Protocol layer:** Use a CLI shim to transparently connect to the official app-server and forward Codex requests unchanged.
- **Harness layer:** Integrate each Harness through its native interface: Pi uses the official RPC, while Claude Code uses the Agent SDK / CLI. Each Harness is then projected into the Desktop's existing streaming output, tools, diffs, approvals, and questions.

The goal is fidelity, not merely making the conversation work. Streaming, tool status, reliable patches, native approvals, and questions should come from the Harness itself whenever possible, rather than being guessed or fabricated by the Host.
